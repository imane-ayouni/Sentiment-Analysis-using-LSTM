# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM
An LSTM to predict the sentiment in a text


## Topic
In this notebook I will be working with and LSTM network to predict the sentiment in a sentence or paragraph. This is a supervised learning task seen as my sentences and paragraphs will
be labeled. My dataset is in txt format, and my goal is to preprocess the textual data to make it machine learning ready, then feed it to LSTM cells that will take into account every word 
in the text to finally produce an answer (whether the input is positive or negative). So let's get started!

## Objectives
- Process the textual data to make it machine learning ready
- Predict the sentiment using a trained LSTM
